<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B" target="_blank" rel="noopener">C++</a> program featured in this tutorial web page demonstrates the concept of Object Oriented Programming (<a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OOP</a>); especially the concept of <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polymorphism</a> (i.e. implementing data types which inherit abstract attributes which can be made more concrete and specific).</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The program implements user defined data types for instantiating <strong>POLYGON</strong> type objects (and POLYGON is an <strong>abstract class</strong>) which are instances of either the POLYGON-derived non-abstract class named <strong>QUADRILATERAL</strong> or else the QUADRILATERAL-derived non-abstract class named <strong>TRAPEZOID</strong> or else the QUADRILATERAL-derived non-abstract class named <strong>RECTANGLE</strong> or else the RECTANGLE-derived non-abstract class named <strong>SQUARE</strong> or else the POLYGON-derived non-abstract class named <strong>TRILATERAL</strong> or else the TRILATERAL-derived non-abstract class named <strong>RIGHT_TRILATERAL</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">Each non-abstract POLYGON type object object represents either three or else four instances of the <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/point/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">POINT</a> class such that each POINT instance represents a unique whole number coordinate pair and such that the polygon represented by the points whose coordinates are data members of the non-abstract POLYGON instance has a non-zero area and, if the polygon is an instance of TRILATERAL, the sum of the interior angles of that polygon is 180 degrees and, if the polygon is an instance of QUADRILATERAL, the sum of the interior angles of that polygon is 360 degrees.</span></p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">A non-abstract POLYGON object can execute various functions including the ability to compute the <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area" target="_blank" rel="noopener">area</a> of the two-dimensional region whose boundaries are the line segments which connect the points which the POINT type variables of the non-abstract POLYGON object represent and the ability to compute the <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perimeter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perimeter</a> (i.e. length of the one-dimensional boundary of the two-dimensional area) which the non-abstract POLYGON object represents.</span></p>

<p>The following source code defines the client which implements the POINT class, the POLYGON class, the QUADRILATERAL class, the TRAPEZOID class, the RECTANGLE class, the SQUARE class, the TRILATERAL class, and the RIGHT_TRILATERAL class. The client executes a series of unit tests which demonstrate how the&nbsp; methods of those classes work.</p>
