<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B" target="_blank" rel="noopener">C++</a> program featured in this tutorial web page illustrates how to use pointer variables to instantiate arrays during program runtime. A <strong>pointer</strong> is a variable which stores the memory address of a variable. An <strong>array</strong> is a variable which is used to store some natural number of data values of the same data type. At the hardware level, an array comprised of N elements whose data type is DATA_TYPE is a contiguous block of DATA_TYPE multiplied by N memory cells. </span></p>

<pre>int N = 99; // An int type variable which stores the initial value 99.
int * P = &amp;N; // A pointer-to-int type variable which stores the address of N (and &amp; is the reference operator).
std::cout &lt;&lt; P; // 0x559343ab78fc (memory address of one byte-sized memory cell (and the first of four contiguous memory cells allocated to N))
std::cout &lt;&lt; * P; // 99 (and * is the dereference operator (which is used to retrieve the data value stored at the memory address which P stores))
int * K = new int [N]; // A pointer-to-int type variable is used to allocate N int-sized contiguous chunks of memory during program runtime (and not during program compile time) to an array of int type values named K.

<p><strong>PROGRAM_COMPILATION_AND_EXECUTION</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>STEP_0: Copy and paste the C++ <a style="background:#000000;color:#00ff00;" href="https://github.com/karlinarayberinger/karlina_object_2022_starter_pack/blob/main/pointers_and_arrays.cpp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source code</a> into a new text editor document and save that document as the following file name:</p>
<pre>pointers_and_arrays.cpp</pre>
<p>STEP_1: Open a <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unix</a> command line terminal application and set the current directory to wherever the C++ is located on the local machine (e.g. Desktop).</p>
<pre>cd Desktop</pre>
<p>STEP_2: Compile the C++ file into machine-executable instructions (i.e. object file) and then into an executable piece of software named <strong>app</strong> using the following command:</p>
<pre>g++ pointers_and_arrays.cpp -o app</pre>
<p>STEP_3: If the program compilation command does not work, then use the following command to install the C++ compiler:</p>
<pre>sudo apt install build-essential</pre>
<p>STEP_4: After running the <strong>g++</strong> command, run the executable file using the following command:</p>
<pre>./app</pre>
<p>STEP_5: Once the application is running, the following prompt will appear:</p>
<pre>Enter a natural number, S, for representing the number of elements to include in an array which is no larger than 1000:</pre>
<p>STEP_6: Enter a value for S using the using the keyboard.</p>
<p>STEP_7: Another prompt for keyboard input will appear after the first input value is entered:</p>
<pre>Enter a natural number, T, for representing the number of unique states which each element of the array can store exactly one of which is no larger than 1000:</pre>
<p>STEP_8: Enter a value for T using the keyboard.</p>
<p>STEP_9: Observe program results on the command line terminal and in the <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://github.com/karlinarayberinger/karlina_object_2022_starter_pack/blob/main/pointers_and_arrays_output.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">output file</a>.</p>

STEP_3: CREATE A DYNAMIC ARRAY WHICH IS NAMED B AND WHICH IS COMPRISED OF T INT TYPE VALUES.

--------------------------------

// Declare a pointer-to-int type variable named B.
int * B;

// Allocate T contiguous int-sized chunks of memory and store the memory address of the first int-sized chunk of memory, B[0], inside the pointer-to-int type variable named B.
B = new int [T];

--------------------------------

B = 0x55be9fc45940. // memory address of B[0]

B[0] = 0.	// &amp;B[0] =	0x55be9fc45940.	(memory address of the first memory cell comprising the block of 4 contiguous memory cells allocated to B[0]).

B[6] = 0.	// &amp;B[6] =	0x55be9fc45958.	(memory address of the first memory cell comprising the block of 4 contiguous memory cells allocated to B[6]).

--------------------------------

STEP_4: FOR EACH ELEMENT B[i] OF THE ARRAY NAMED B, STORE THE NUMBER OF TIMES i APPEARS AS AN ELEMENT VALUE IN THE ARRAY NAMED A.

--------------------------------

B = 0x55be9fc45940. // memory address of B[0]

B[0] = 6.	// &amp;B[0] =	0x55be9fc45940.	(memory address of the first memory cell comprising the block of 4 contiguous memory cells allocated to B[0]).

--------------------------------

STEP_5: CREATE A DYNAMIC ARRAY WHICH IS NAMED C AND WHICH IS COMPRISED OF T POINTER-TO-CHAR TYPE VALUES.

--------------------------------

// Declare one pointer-to-pointer-to-char type variable.
char ** C;

// Allocate T contiguous pointer-to-char-sized chunks of memory and store the memory address of the first pointer-to-char-sized chunk of memory, C[0], inside the pointer-to-pointer-to-char type variable named C.
C = new char * [T];

// C is a two-dimensional array which depicts a histogram (i.e. bar graph) such the length of the ith row is identical to the value stored in B[i].
for (i = 0; i &lt; T; i += 1)
{
    C[i] = new char [B[i]];
    for (k = 0; k &lt; B[i]; k += 1) C[i][k] = 'X';
}

--------------------------------

C = 0x55be9fc45970. // memory address of C[0]

C[0] = XXXXXX.	// &amp;C[0] =	0x55be9fc45970.	(memory address of the first memory cell comprising the block of 8 contiguous memory cells allocated to C[0]).
C[1] = XXXXXX.	// &amp;C[1] =	0x55be9fc45978.	(memory address of the first memory cell comprising the block of 8 contiguous memory cells allocated to C[1]).
C[2] = XXX.	// &amp;C[2] =	0x55be9fc45980.	(memory address of the first memory cell comprising the block of 8 contiguous memory cells allocated to C[2]).
C[3] = XXXXXX.	// &amp;C[3] =	0x55be9fc45988.	(memory address of the first memory cell comprising the block of 8 contiguous memory cells allocated to C[3]).
C[4] = X.	// &amp;C[4] =	0x55be9fc45990.	(memory address of the first memory cell comprising the block of 8 contiguous memory cells allocated to C[4]).
C[5] = XXXXX.	// &amp;C[5] =	0x55be9fc45998.	(memory address of the first memory cell comprising the block of 8 contiguous memory cells allocated to C[5]).
C[6] = XXX.	// &amp;C[6] =	0x55be9fc459a0.	(memory address of the first memory cell comprising the block of 8 contiguous memory cells allocated to C[6]).

--------------------------------

STEP_6: RELEASE MEMORY WHICH WAS ALLOCATED TO THE DYNAMIC ARRAYS NAMED A, B, AND C.

--------------------------------

// De-allocate memory which was assigned to the dynamically-allocated array of S int type values.
delete [] A; // Free up S contiguous int-sized chunks of memory which were assigned to the dynamic array named A.

De-allocate memory which was assigned to the dynamically-allocated array of T int type values.
delete [] B; // Free up T contiguous int-sized chunks of memory which were assigned to the dynamic array named B.

// De-allocate memory which was assigned to the dynamically-allocated array of T pointer-to-char type values.
for (i = 0; i &lt; T; i += 1) delete [] C[i]; // Free up B[i] char-sized chunks of memory which were assigned to the dynamic array named C[i].
delete [] C; // Free up T contiguous pointer-to-char-sized chunks of memory which were assigned to the dynamic array named C.
