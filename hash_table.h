/**
 * A variable whose data type is HASH_TABLE is a software object whose data attributes
 * consist of exactly one pointer-to-LINKED_LIST type variable named array 
 * and exactly one int type variable named N.
 * 
 * N stores a nonnegative integer value no larger than MAXIMUM_N.
 * 
 * array stores the memory address of the first memory cell of a LINKED_LIST sized chunk of contiguous memory cells
 * (and array is a pointer to the first element of an array comprised of N LINKED_LIST type elements).
 * 
 * When a HASH_TABLE type variable is declared, a dynamic LINKED_LIST type variable is created
 * and the memory address of that dynamic LINKED_LIST type variable is stored in a pointer-to-LINKED_LIST
 * type variable named array.
 * 
 * After a HASH_TABLE type variable is created and before that variable is deleted, 
 * NODE type elements can be inserted into the hash table array and
 * NODE type elements can be removed from the hash table array.
 * 
 * When a NODE is inserted into the hash table array, a hash function takes that NODE's key as 
 * a hash function input and then the hash function outputs a corresponding nonnegative integer
 * no larger than (N - 1) which represents the index of the hash table array where that
 * NODE will be inserted (and that NODE will be appended to the end of the LINKED_LIST which is stored at 
 * that particular array index).
 * 
 * After a HASH_TABLE type variable is created and before that variable is deleted,
 * that variable (i.e. object) can invoke a print function which prints a description
 * of the caller HASH_TABLE object.
 * 
 * When a HASH_TABLE variable is deleted, the pointer-to-LINKED_LIST type variable named array 
 * (which was assigned memory during program runtime rather than during program compilation time) 
 * and every head property of every LINKED_LIST type element of that array
 * is deleted.
