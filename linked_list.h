 * A variable whose data type is LINKED_LIST is a software object whose data attributes
 * consist of exactly one pointer-to-NODE type variable which is assumed to be the 
 * first node of a linear and unidirectional linked list.
 * 
 * When a LINKED_LIST type variable is declared, a dynamic NODE type variable is created
 * and the memory address of that dynamic NODE type variable is stored in a pointer-to-NODE
 * type variable named head.
 * 
 * After a LINKED_LIST type variable is created and before that variable is deleted, 
 * NODE type elements can be inserted into the list which the LINKED_LIST type variable represents
 * and NODE type elements can be removed from the list which the LINKED_LIST type variable represents.
 * 
 * After a LINKED_LIST type ariable is created and before that variable is deleted,
 * that variable (i.e. object) can invoke a print function which prints a description
 * of the caller LINKED_LIST object.
 * 
 * When a LINKED_LIST variable is deleted, the pointer-to-NODE type variable named head 
 * (which was assigned memory during program runtime rather than during program compilation time) 
 * is deleted.
