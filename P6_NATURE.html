<p><strong>NATURE</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The following terms and their respective definitions describe <strong>nature</strong> (i.e. the whole of reality) as being the set which contains all phenomena, all noumena, and all of pure nothingness.</span></p>

<hr>
<p><strong>NOTHINGNESS:</strong> the ubiquitous, featureless, irreducible, and immutable substrate into which all phenomena are projected.</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">According to <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panpsychism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">panpsychism</a> (i.e. the hypothesis which posits that the entirety of nature is contained inside of one ubiquitous mind and that each phenomenon is a component of some dream which that mind constructs and experiences (as the audience of every dream throughout all existence)), pure nothingness is synonymous with pure consciousness (which means that nature is fundamentally sentient).</span></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>PHENOMENON:</strong> (plural: phenomena) a finite region of space which is distinguishable from pure nothingness due to the fact that the finite region of space is perceived (by some frame of reference) as containing specific quantifiable features.</p>
<p>An example of a phenomenon is a light sensor detecting incoming <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light" target="_blank" rel="noopener">light</a> whose wavelengths are exactly 700 nanometers and not some other wavelength such as 470 nanometers. (Human vision perceives light whose wavelengths are between 625 and 740 nanometers as the color <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red" target="_blank" rel="noopener">red</a>. By contrast, human vision perceives light whose wavelengths are between 450 and 495 nanometers as the color <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blue</a>).</p>
<p>Another example of a phenomenon is a particular configuration of electrons inside the electronic circuits of a computer&#8217;s random access memory (<a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RAM</a>) such that the configuration of electrons is interpreted by the computer as a specific piece of <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computer_science)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data</a> such as the <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number" target="_blank" rel="noopener">number</a> five.</p>
<p>(Perhaps the integer value 5 is stored &#8220;inside of&#8221; an int type variable named <strong>N</strong> and that variable is being used by a running instance of a C++ program (and the relatively <strong>virtual</strong> phenomenon referred to as N exists as a result of there being the relatively <strong>physical</strong> phenomenon of four contiguous byte-sized memory cells in RAM being allocated to the instantiation of that program variable named N). <span style="background:#00ff00;">The phenomenon N would be an object comprised of the relatively immutable attribute of a <strong>memory address</strong> (of the first memory cell of four contiguous memory cells) such as <strong>0x55564dbc593c</strong> and the relatively mutable attribute of exactly one <strong>data value</strong> per instant during that object&#8217;s lifespan such as <strong>5</strong>, <strong>12</strong>, or <strong>-33</strong>).</span></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>FRAME_OF_REFERENCE:</strong> an allocation of pure nothingness which renders specific phenomena.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>NOUMENON:</strong> (plural: noumena) a specific phenomenon which is not being observed by some partial frame of reference (according to that particular frame of reference).</p>
<p>Suppose that two unique frames of reference exist and that one of those frames of reference, A, is observing some phenomenon, X, while the other frame of reference, B, is not observing X. Then, according to B, X is a noumenon.</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">(Even while A renders the phenomenon labeled X,&nbsp; a noumenal copy of X unconditionally and ubiquitously exists throughout all of nature&nbsp; (including within the scope of A&#8217;s frame of reference (which means that, whether or not A renders X, A always contains the noumenal counterpart to X)).</span></p>
<p>Note that there are at least as many unique noumena as there are unique phenomena because each instance of a unique phenomenon has an identical corresponding &#8220;template&#8221; noumenal counterpart while each noumenon does not necessarily have at least one phenomenal counterpart. (Any frame of reference contains all noumena simultaneously and immutably but that frame of reference does not necessarily render all phenomena simultaneously).</p>
