<p><strong>NATURE</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">The following terms and their respective definitions describe <strong>nature</strong> (i.e. the whole of reality) as being the set which contains all phenomena, all noumena, and all of pure nothingness.</span></p>

<p><strong>NOTHINGNESS:</strong> the ubiquitous, featureless, irreducible, and immutable substrate into which all phenomena are projected.</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">According to <a style="background:#ff9000;color:#000000;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panpsychism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">panpsychism</a> (i.e. the hypothesis which posits that the entirety of nature is contained inside of one ubiquitous mind and that each phenomenon is a component of some dream which that mind constructs and experiences (as the audience of every dream throughout all existence)), pure nothingness is synonymous with pure consciousness (which means that nature is fundamentally sentient).</span></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>PHENOMENON:</strong> (plural: phenomena) a finite region of space which is distinguishable from pure nothingness due to the fact that the finite region of space is perceived (by some frame of reference) as containing specific quantifiable features.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>FRAME_OF_REFERENCE:</strong> an allocation of pure nothingness which renders specific phenomena.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>NOUMENON:</strong> (plural: noumena) a specific phenomenon which is not being observed by some partial frame of reference (according to that particular frame of reference).</p>
<p>Suppose that two unique frames of reference exist and that one of those frames of reference, A, is observing some phenomenon, X, while the other frame of reference, B, is not observing X. Then, according to B, X is a noumenon.</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00;">(Even while A renders the phenomenon labeled X,  a noumenal copy of X unconditionally and ubiquitously exists throughout all of nature  (including within the scope of A&#8217;s frame of reference (which means that, whether or not A renders X, A always contains the noumenal counterpart to X)).</span></p>
<p>Note that there are at least as many unique noumena as there are unique phenomena because each instance of a unique phenomenon has an identical corresponding &#8220;template&#8221; noumenal counterpart while each noumenon does not necessarily have at least one phenomenal counterpart. (Any frame of reference contains all noumena simultaneously and immutably but that frame of reference does not necessarily render all phenomena simultaneously).</p>
